# pizza order
## Description
This is my first Java program. The goal was to discover Java by using the Object Oriented Programming and to link a database (MySQL).

When the programm start, we are asked to order our pizza (what base, topping and cheese we want), then this pizza is registered in the database.  
After that, the pizza is retrived from the database and displayed in the terminal.
